# deep-learning-with-tensorflow
Assignments for the Deep Learning course at WUST (Wroclaw University of Science and Technology). Tensorflow library was used to solve the tasks.

1. MLP
	* Implementation of the basic architecture of the Multilayer Perceptron and exploration of the effect of hyperparameters on learning and on the quality of the obtained results. The network solves the problem of image classification from a set of architectural styles.

2. CNN
	* Exploring the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the task of image classification (implementation and hyperparamters tuning). Attempt to improve the quality of classification using Data Augmentation and regularization (Dropout, Weight decay). The network solves the problem of image classification from a set of architectural styles.

3. RNN
	* Application of recurrent networks in natural language analysis. The task explores the performance in a text topic classification task on a set of Reuters articles. RNN, LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM (bidirectional sequence processing) networks were used (implementation and hyperparamters tuning). Besides, publicly available pre-trained text representation methods were also tested.
